\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this article is to assist building administrators to identify misbehaving devices in large buildings infrastructure.
Consequently, we proposed an unsupervised method to systematically detect abnormal energy-consumption in buildings: the Strip, Bind, and Search (SBS) method.
SBS uncovers the inter-device usage patterns by striping dominant trends off the devices energy-consumption.
Then, it monitors the devices usages and report misbehaving devices.
Our main contribution is to develop an unsupervised technique to uncover the devices intrinsic relationships that are hidden by the noise and dominant trends inherent to the sensor raw data.
The resulting tool is used indifferently on two sets of traces captured at two buildings with fundamentally different infrastructures.
The abnormal consumption identified in these two buildings are mainly energy waste.
The most important one being an instance of competing heater and cooler that caused the heater to waste around 2500~kWh.
