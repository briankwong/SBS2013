\begin{abstract}
In this paper we describe a tool for uncovering energy savings opportunities in buildings called 
the \emph{Energy-Savings Headhunter}.  Headhunter is based on the recently proposed, Strip, Bind, and
Search (SBS) method -- a multi-stage, unsupervised anomaly detection technique that uncovers when device
usage patterns deviate from normal use; a potential savings opportunity.  The tools
takes a data log of all sensors in the building and unovers ``interesting'' segments in the data
where the usage pattern changed significantly.  Our tool is 
currently being tested with building and sustainability managers at several universities and we  
describe how the data being gathered can be used to better understand \emph{how} to make buildings
more energy efficient.
