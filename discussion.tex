\section{Discussion}
Really unsupervised! in this article the sensors type and location are known in order to evaluate the proposed approach, however, in real deployment it is not needed.

We don't need any occupancy model. It founds device in the clusters that betray the building occupancy. e.g. light, elevator.

The proposed approach is designed to be flexible and for example it can be used with different correlation metrics like the Granger causality \cite{kim:buildsys2010}.

The goal of this article is to develop a tool that enables to identify energy wastes in an unsupervised manner.
however more work is needed to allow on line detection: use of smaller time bin.

season changes; devices relationships have seasonal pattern thus we may need forecast models such as ARIMA to make the reference matrix evolve in time.

positive/negative correlation

limitation: the proposed method is useless in case the intrinsic-related devices are left ON all the time..


advantage of EMD to monitor sensor data; residual data provide information on the device types.
This could be used in understanding the sensor semantics TODO add ref
