\section{Demo description}
We have integrated SBS into a fully functional anomaly detectiong system for building managers.  The system 
is desgined as a web application that take a bulk-data feed, runs SBS on the data, and displays the associated 
signals where anomalies have been detected.  This system address two challenges that are not addressed in the 
paper~\cite{SBS}.  It accepts user input on the anomalies that were detected, so that the system can learn
how to distinguish between a potential false-positive and true-positive.  Secondly, it provides a common vocabulary
to users to help normalize the data across data set and buildings.  A \emph{major} challenge in buildings 
is that the vocabulary and inter-relationships between the sensor, spaces, and sub-system varies slightly
from building to building.  By providing a tagging mechanism, we attempt to embedded symantic information
that, in time, can be used to characterize the classes of anomalies and faults found with the SBS tool.
