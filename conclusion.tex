\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this article is to provide to building administrators tools that assist them to prevent electricity waste.
Consequently, we proposed a new approach to systematically detect abnormal energy-consumption in buildings, the Strip, Bind, and Search (SBS) method.
SBS uncovers the inter-device usage patterns by striping dominant trends off the traces.
Then, it monitors the devices usage and report misbehaving devices.
Our main contribution is to develop an unsupervised technique to uncover the devices intrinsic relationships that are hidden by the noise and dominant patterns inherent to the sensor raw data.
This technique makes the proposed tool really practical as demonstrated by our evaluation using data from two buildings that have fundamentally different infrastructures.
Different types of energy waste are identified in this two buildings. 
The most important one being an instance of competing heater and cooler that caused the heater to waste around 2500~kWh.
